// THE OBJECT TYPE

// Objects are a Data Type, like string or arrays
// they store other data like an array stores elements

// Objects store VALUE that is associated with a KEY
// KEYS are almost always strings
// VALUES can be any data type: numbers, strings, arrays, other objects, etc.

// In other programming languages similar data structures are
// referred to as "dictionaries", "maps", or "associative arrays"
