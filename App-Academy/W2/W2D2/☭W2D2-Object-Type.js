// THE OBJECT TYPE

// Objects are a Data Type, like string or arrays
// they store other data like an array stores elements

// Objects store VALUE that is associated with a KEY
// KEYS are almost always strings
// VALUES can be any data type: numbers, strings, arrays, other objects, etc.

// In other programming languages similar data structures are
// referred to as "dictionaries", "maps", or "associative arrays"

// Difference from Arrays:
// 1. Instead of accessing values within an object through an index with numbers,
// objects are indexed using KEYS
// 2. Order is NOT guaranteed within an Object. When you iterate through the values
// in an object, they may not be in the same order as when they were entered.
