// Array reduce is helpful when you have an array of multiple numbers or elements
// and you want to reduce the array to a single value.
// For example, you can use reduce to find a mathematical sum
// or even compare word lengths to return the longest word of an array.


// List the arguments that should be used with the Array reduce method
// Explain the difference between the accumulator and initialValue parameters
