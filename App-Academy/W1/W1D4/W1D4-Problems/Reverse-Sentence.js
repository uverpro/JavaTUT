// Reverse Sentence
// Write a function reverseSentence(sentence) that takes in a sentence as an arg.
// The function should return a new sentence where the order of the words is reversed.
// Note that you should reverse the order among words, not the order among characters.

reverseSentence = (sentence) => {

};

console.log(reverseSentence('I am pretty hungry')); // 'hungry pretty am I'
console.log(reverseSentence('follow the yellow brick road')); // 'road brick yellow the follow'
