// String Included (*)
// Write a function named eitherStringIncluded(sentence, word1, word2)
// that accepts a sentence and two words as arguments.
// The eitherStringIncluded function should return true if either word1 or word2 is found in the sentence,
// and false if neither is found.
// Hint: the String.includes method will return true or false if a given string is included in another string.
