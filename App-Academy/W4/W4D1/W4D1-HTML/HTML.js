// HTML

// HTML is a MARKUP LANGUAGE, not a programming language.
// HTML consists of a series of elements, which are enclosed, wrapped, or marked up
// The enclosing tags make content into a hyperlink to connect another page,
    // italicize words, etc. Example:
        My cat is very grumpy
        // to make the text stand alone, enclose with paragraph <p> element:
            <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
// Note: Tags are case insensitive


// Anatomy of HTML:
// Opening tag            Closing tag
//   |                        |
    <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
//     |      CONTENT      |
//  \         ELEMENT          /

// The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph),
    // wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.
    // This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect.
    // In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
// The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
// The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes
    // a forward slash before the element name.
    // This marks where the element ends.
    // Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that
    // can produce peculiar results.
