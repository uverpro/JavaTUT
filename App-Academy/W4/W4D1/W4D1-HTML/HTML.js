// HTML

// HTML is a MARKUP LANGUAGE, not a programming language.
// HTML consists of a series of elements, which are enclosed, wrapped, or marked up
// The enclosing tags make content into a hyperlink to connect another page,
    // italicize words, etc. Example:
        My cat is very grumpy
        // to make the text stand alone, enclose with paragraph <p> element:
            <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
// Note: Tags are case insensitive


// Anatomy of HTML:
// Opening tag            Closing tag
//   |                        |
    <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
//     |      CONTENT      |
//  \         ELEMENT          /

// 1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph),
    // wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.
    // This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect.
// 2. The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
// 3. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes
    // a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends.

// Nesting Elements:
{/* <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p> */}


// Block verses Inline Elements
// Block-level elements form a visible block on a page.
    // A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it.
    // Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line.
    // Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page.
    // For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists,
    // navigation menus, or footers.
    // A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element,
    // but it might be nested inside another block-level element.

// Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts
    // of the documentâ€™s content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content).
    // An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document.
    // It is typically used with text, for example an <a> element creates a hyperlink,
    // and elements such as <em> or <strong> create emphasis.

{/* <em>first</em><em>second</em><em>third</em> */}
// <em> is an inline element. All sit on the same line, no space between
// firstsecondthird

{/* <p>fourth</p><p>fifth</p><p>sixth</p> */}
// <p> is a block level. Each p element on a new line, with space above/below
// fourth

// fifth

// sixth


// Empty Elements
// Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
    // Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed
    // something in the document.
    // For example, the <img> element embeds an image file onto a page:
{/* <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-
    html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"></img> */}
// Note: Empty elements are sometimes called "void elements"


// Attributes
// Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:
// <p class="editor-note">My cat is very grump</p>
//    \    ATTRIBUTE    /
// Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
// In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to
// target the element with style information.

// An attribute should have:
    // A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute,
        //  the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
    // The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
    // An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.


// Adding attributes to an element:
    // <a> is an ANCHOR TAG.
        // An anchor makes the text it encloses in a hyperlinke.

// Several attributes an anchor can take:

    // href: This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link.
        // For example: href="https://www.mozilla.org/".

    // title: The title attribute specifies extra information about the link,
    // such as a description of the page that is being linked to.
        // For example, title="The Mozilla homepage".
        //  This appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.

    // target: The target attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link.
        //  For example, target="_blank" will display the link in a new tab.
        //  If you want to display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.


// Boolean Attributes
