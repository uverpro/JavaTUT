// HTML

// HTML is a MARKUP LANGUAGE, not a programming language.
// HTML consists of a series of elements, which are enclosed, wrapped, or marked up
// The enclosing tags make content into a hyperlink to connect another page,
    // italicize words, etc. Example:
        My cat is very grumpy
        // to make the text stand alone, enclose with paragraph <p> element:
            <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
// Note: Tags are case insensitive


// Anatomy of HTML:
// Opening tag            Closing tag
//   |                        |
    <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
//     |      CONTENT      |
//  \         ELEMENT          /
