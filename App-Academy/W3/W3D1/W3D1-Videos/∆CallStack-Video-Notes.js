// The Call Stack


// What is the Call Stack?
// The call stack is the structure used in the JavaScript runtime
// to track the execution of function calls.


// Stack Data Structure
// It's like a pile of many items
// New items must be place on the top of the pile (push)
// Only the top item of the pile can be removed (pop)


// Mainpulating the Call Stack
// The items placed on the call stack are refered to as STACK FRAMES
// When a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack
// When a function returns, the frame on the top of the stack is popped off the stack
