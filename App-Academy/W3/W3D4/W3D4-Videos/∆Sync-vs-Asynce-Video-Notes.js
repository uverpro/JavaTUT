// SYNCHRONOUS vs ASYNCHRONOUS CODE

// WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE SYNCHRONOUS?

    // In SYNCHRONOUS programming, we must wait for the current command to complete
// before moving executing another command.
    // There is an inherent order to synchronous code!

// WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ASYNCHRONOUS?

    // In ASYNCHRONOUS programming, we can continue to execute another command,
// even if the current command has not yet been completed.
    // There may not be a gauranteed order to asynchronous code!
