// THE CALL STACK

// What is the Call Stack?
// The call stack is the structure used in the JavaScript runtime to track
// the execution of function calls

// Stack Data Structure
// A pile of many items
// New items must be place on top of the pile (push)
// Only the top item of the pile can be removed (pop)

//Manipulating the Call Stack
// The items placed on the call stack are referred to as stack frames
// When a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack
// When a function returns, the from the top of the stack is popped off the stack
