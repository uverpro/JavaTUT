// Write a function named `productUpTo(max)` that accepts a max number as an argument. The function
// should return the total product of all whole numbers from 1 to the max, inclusive. A product is a
// number obtained from multiplying numbers together.
//
// For example, productUpTo(4) should return 24 because 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
